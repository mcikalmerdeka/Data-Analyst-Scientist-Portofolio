# Muhammad Cikal Merdeka - Data Analytics/Science Portofolio

## About
Hi I'm Cikal, I have an analytical background and hold a Bachelor of Science (S.si) degree in Physics from Institut Teknologi Bandung focusing on Hybrid Solar Cell research.

My graduation in 2023, a pivotal year marked by significant advancements in artificial intelligence with the introduction of GPT-4 and other generative AI models, has fueled my curiosity and excitement to delve into the field of data.
Currently, I am actively deepening my knowledge in data science through various sources, including bootcamps and online courses.
I am keenly seeking opportunities for internships or full-time positions in the data field to gain early experiences and collaborate with accomplished professionals who are willing to mentor and guide me in furthering my expertise in data science.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.
