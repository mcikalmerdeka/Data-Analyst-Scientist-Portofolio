# Muhammad Cikal Merdeka - Data Analytics/Science Portofolio (Guidance Repository)

## About
Hi I'm Cikal, I have an analytical background and hold a Bachelor of Science (S.si) degree in Physics from Institut Teknologi Bandung focusing on Hybrid Solar Cell research.

My graduation in 2023, a pivotal year marked by significant advancements in artificial intelligence with the introduction of GPT-4 and other generative AI models, has fueled my curiosity and excitement to delve into the field of data.
Currently, I am actively deepening my knowledge in data science through various sources, including bootcamps and online courses.
I am keenly seeking opportunities for internships or full-time positions in the data field to gain early experiences and collaborate with accomplished professionals who are willing to mentor and guide me in furthering my expertise in data science.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
Here are some data analytics and data science projects I have worked on. The tech stack used varies for each project, but overall, the combined stack across all projects includes:

* SQL (PostgreSQL & MySQL)
* Python (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, sckit-learn)
* Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets
* Tableau
* Looker
* Git & GitGub

<b>! Note : Modifications have been made to several projects in alignment with the integration of recently acquired knowledge</b>

### 1. Indonesia College Entrance Examination - UTBK 2019
* Repository : [Indonesia_College_Entrance_Examination_UTBK_2019 Codes (Python and SQL)](https://github.com/mcikalmerdeka/Indonesia-College-Entrance-Examination-UTBK-2019)

* Tableau Dashboard : [Link to Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cikal.merdeka/viz/IndonesiaCollegeEntranceExamination-UTBK2019Result/IndonesiaCollegeEntranceExamination-UTBK2019ResultScience?publish=yes)

* Goal : To analyze and compile a report on the results of the 2019 UTBK (Academic Potential Test for State Universities) for both the Science & Technology (SAINTEK) and Social Humanities (SOSHUM) clusters.

* Description : UTBK SBMPTN is the annual college entrance exam held by and for state universities in Indonesia. This data was collected from a ranking site where exam takers could submit their score in order to gauge how well they did in comparison to others. There are about 147 thousand samples (out of 1.1 million total scores) and this data is not indicative of the whole 1.1 million dataset as it is collected from a third-party sources (with maybe some invalid data strewn in). This dataset also contains the major picked by those exam-takers.

* Personal Notes : This is my first personal project after 2.5 months of starting to learn data-related fields from scratch. I chose the education field because it is one of the domain I have a passion and interest in, and if given the opportunity, I would like to experience what's it like to work in that domain in the future, though i also want to learn about other domains as well like e-commerce, retail, finance, etc. There are several shortcomings in this project, but I did my best and learned many technical and non-technical aspects, one of which is the difficulty of finding raw data in Indonesia compared to English-language data. Most of the data is confined within government or private institutions, and very little is available as open-source data.

### 2. US Based Ecommerce Company Sales Performance
* Repository : [Ecommerce Sales Codes (Python and SQL)](https://github.com/mcikalmerdeka/US-Based-Ecommerce-Company-Sales-Performance)

* Tableau Dashboard : [Link to Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cikal.merdeka/viz/USBasedEcommerceCompanySalesPerformance/SalesPerformanceDashboard?publish=yes)

* Goal : To analyze key indicators in a ecommerce company sales data in order to gain insights into their business performance.

* Description : A US Based Ecommerce Sales Company wants us to create a sales dashboard showing information of YTD sales and various others to generate insights for improving business performance. The given dataset contains information on 113 thousand sales records based on product categories, customer segments, cities, and states of customer residence, and various many others.

* Personal Notes : I am embarking on this project to enhance my proficiency in handling datasets with numerous variables and parameters, which also includes a time dimension represented by date values. Among the datasets known for encompassing a diverse range of columns, sales data, particularly in the realm of e-commerce, as i know is one of the most common and rich sources.

### 3. Ecommerce Google Ads Data Analysis
* Repository : [Ecommerce Google Ads Analysis](https://github.com/mcikalmerdeka/Ecommerce-Google-Ads-Data-Analysis)

* Looker Studio Dashboard : [Link to Looker Studio Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/90de1d92-08c9-47af-b13d-76bb93010a33)

* Goal : To analyze Google Ads data from an ecommerce company and find insights from the performance metrics of each campaign conducted.

* Description : This was originally from my bootcamp task on Looker Studio, but I think I would just add it to this list for kind of like a mini project. The dataset used is from Looker Studio's sample data of AdWords (now known as Google Ads) Data, which contains information about the metrics of each campaign. The task demanded us to formulate our own list of metrics to be displayed based on our own data understanding, and in this case, I am using ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) as the main metric to analyze its performance.

* Personal Notes : There is a drawback in using Looker Studio's sample data where the provided data is always updated. As a result, the display of performance metrics that was initially done in comparison to the previous period (the previous month) may be affected. The original dashboard presentation during the analysis can be viewed in the report file. I wanted to do more analysis using SQL or Python but unfortunately the sample data can't be downloaded.

### 4. Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior (Currently On-progress)
* Repository : [Loan Prediction (Python)](https://github.com/mcikalmerdeka/Dackers)

* Goal :
1. Efficiency improvement: Enhancing the credit risk assessment process to be more efficient and less time-consuming.
2. Accuracy improvement in credit risk assessment: Improving the precision of credit risk assessment by employing machine learning models.

* Description : A lending company needs to verify loan applications from its potential borrowers (customers). The company possesses data on previous borrowers along with their creditworthiness (ability to repay or not). The company aims to develop a system that can predict the creditworthiness of future loan applicants based on the data of previous borrowers to minimize the risk of loan default. This is a problem of classification with the business metrics of default rate (%) : The percentage of prospective customers who fail to repay loans.

* Personal Notes : This is the final project of the bootcamp I am currently attending, and the project has been ongoing since the first week of the new year in 2024, with the expectation to conclude by early March as there are still materials to study in class. I hold the role of a team leader, guiding my other 6 team members. In each stage of the project, I consistently create rough sketches (early start) of what the outcomes will look like so that task assignments for each team member can be done effectively.
